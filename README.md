*gnome-shell-extension-panel-osd* is an extension to place shell notifications under the panel instead of above the message-tray.

----

# Installation

After the installation, you might need to restart GNOME Shell (`Alt`+`F2`, `r`, `Enter`) and enable the extension through *gnome-tweak-tool*.

## Through extensions.gnome.org (Local installation)

Go on the [Panel OSD](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/708/panel-osd/) extension page on extensions.gnome.org, click on the switch ("OFF" => "ON"), click on the install button. That's it !

## Through a package manager

#### Note: you need the root password for all these installation modes, if you do not have root-access, and the needed build-dependencies are installed, use the generic install.

### [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)
